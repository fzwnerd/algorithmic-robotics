COMP/ELEC/MECH 450/550
Project 4

What are we doing?
------------------

This project requires you to:
 1. Copy your implementation of your validity checkers from Project 2. This
 amounts to copy and pasting "CollisionChecking.cpp" into Project 4.
 2. Implement Reachability-Guided RRT (RG-RRT) in "RG-RRT.cpp" and "RG-RRT.h".
 You should start from the existing implementation RRT in OMPL. Note that this
 time we are doing control planning, rather than geometric.
 3. Implement the exercise code that uses your planner in "Project3Pendulum.cpp"
 and "Project3Car.cpp".

You may freely add code to any of these files for your implementation. Your
implementation must be self-contained. In other words, you may NOT invoke other
programs or link against other libraries to perform any of the project
exercises; the implementation must be your own.

All code for this project should be placed under the `src` directory.

How do I run the code?
----------------------

A (minimal) Makefile is provided. Depending on your system, you may have to
adjust parts of the Makefile. Once compiled, two binary files are produced:
 1. Project3Pendulum, which prompts you for either planning or benchmarking,
 what torque for the pendulum, and in the case of planning what planner to use,
 and
2. Project3Car, which prompts you for planning or benchmarking and in the case
of planning what planner to use.

Please try to avoid modifying the skeleton of "Project3{Car, Pendulum}.cpp".
However, you may add any code or routines that you see fit.

How do I check my code?
-----------------------

The accuracy of your implementation will be assessed. You are required to
visualize your paths generated in both cases for the report, and this
visualization will be an invaluable tool for your debugging process. You can
copy code provided from the OMPL tutorial as a starting point for your
visualization, or you can implement something in your favorite language.
