COMP/ELEC/MECH 450/550
Project 3

What are we doing?
------------------

This project requires you to:
 1. Copy your implementation of your validity checkers from Project 2. This
 amounts to copy and pasting "CollisionChecking.cpp" into Project 3.
 2. Implement the random tree planner (RTP) in "RTP.cpp" and "RTP.h". Feel free
 to start from an existing implementation of a planner in OMPL, such as RRT.
 3. Implement the exercise code that uses your planner in
 "Project3Exercise2.cpp" (for exercise 2) and "Project3Exercise3.cpp" (for
 exercise 3).

You may freely add code to any of these files for your implementation. Your
implementation must be self-contained. In other words, you may NOT invoke other
programs or link against other libraries to perform any of the project
exercises; the implementation must be your own.

All code for this project should be placed under the `src` directory.

How do I run the code?
----------------------

A (minimal) Makefile is provided. Depending on your system, you may have to
adjust parts of the Makefile. Once compiled, two binary files are produced:
 1. Project3Exercise2, which prompts you for which robot and which environment
 you would like to plan for, and
 2. Project3Exercise3, which prompts you for what environment to benchmark against.

Please try to avoid modifying the skeleton of "Project3Exercise{2, 3}.cpp".
However, you may add any code or routines that you see fit.

How do I check my code?
-----------------------

The accuracy of your implementation will be assessed. You are required to
visualize your paths generated in Exercise 2 for the report, and this
visualization will be an invaluable tool for your debugging process. You can
copy code provided from the OMPL tutorial as a starting point for your
visualization, or you can implement something in your favorite language.
